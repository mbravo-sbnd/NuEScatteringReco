# NuEScatteringReco
Repository with the code I used for my reconstruction and analysis of nu-e elastic scattering events in SBND experiment.
Input: simulated single nu-e scattering events, genie + g4 + detsim + reco1 + reco2 standard simulation chain.
This reposotory includes:
- Analyzer module used to obtain the information from the reco2 step output.
- Incoming neutrino direction reconstruction.
- Outgoing electron direction reconstruction through its e.m. shower direction reconstruction.
